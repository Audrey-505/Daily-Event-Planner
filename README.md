# Audrey's-Daily-Event-Planner


## Description 

This repository contains a daily scheduler. This scheduler is color-coded so that the user can see what time optimization options they have at a glance.
Red is the present time, green is future hours available, and gray are hours that have passed. The scheduler gives the user the option to insert an event
for a one hour time block, save that event and use it the whole day to make sure they are on time for all their events. The current day is conveniently positioned
at the top of the page as well.
